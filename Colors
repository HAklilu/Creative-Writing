They couldn't stop laughing, the deadly concoction of laughing gas and cyanide filled the air. The widowed husband watched his vengeance unfold...

Despite their superficial glee, they wished to leave. They traded blame like your feet trade sand in the summer heat. 
You sit behind the glass, watching their lungs take in the gas. There, in dreadful agony, are your late wife's killers. No gun to her head, no knife to her heart, 
they left her for dead. Their gun, cold actions. Their knife, harsh words. And with them, they drove your wife to death, without you being there for her last breath. 
They will die, you swore, they will live the rest of their lives in agony.
 
You think back to your wife and her life. 
She was as happy as can be, happier than the color yellow she could see.
Then she was older, but her life fell apart as well as her heart. All her eyes could show was a blurry rainbow. 
She got worse, she couldn't hit reverse. She cut her skin as she died within. As she bled she couldn't stop seeing red. 
She was trying to stay strong, but that did not work for so long. With the wars in her brain and people filling her with shame, she soon saw purple on her skin. 
She couldn't take it anymore. With her heart and body in gore, she took her last breath as she relieved herself from the stress. She cried out as she kicked the chair, 
leaving you quite empty and bare. 
You wonder what color she saw when the rope made her skin raw. Was it red like her hand when she relapsed, or white perhaps?
