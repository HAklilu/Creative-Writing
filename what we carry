The things we carry are quite simple to me. I do not need to see a pile of things that come out of our pockets. We carry candor, erudite, dauntless, amity, and abnegation. Everything we have stems from those factions. When you have the gum wrapper in your pocket you are being selfless by not throwing it on the ground. The pencil/pen, erudite and the person that carries their transpass or key in their pocket, dauntless. I mean seriously, I lose it all the time, that's some brave stuff. On a deeper level than our pockets and bags. We all have these sections inside us or else we would be in a dystopian world like divergent because our DNA was altered.
