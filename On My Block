On my block
On my block, children used to play outside till the street lights turned on. The kids hula-hooped on the sidewalks till their hips gave out, 
and jumped rope till their soles were sore. On my block, my neighbor Musou said hi with a smile while I always wondered why he smelled so bad. 
The girl next door, Makaiya, always wore colorful barrettes in her hair, and they clinked while she walked. 
Tylenda walked down the street and had the biggest hoops you would ever see and the smallest shorts. Precious, the dog, would roam freely out of her house when she wanted. 
Like Precious, on my block, we would walk freely to the papi store and buy hot chips for a quarter. This was my block. Then I left. I left to go to a new block.
Now the dog is always on a leash. I wear the colorful pins and barrettes. I smell different from everyone because of the coconut and mango in my hair. 
I don't like the games they play, and the cafeteria doesn’t sell hot chips. Nothing is the same. Nothing is the same, not even on my old block. When I go back, it is different. 
The kids are not on the street playing because they moved out; the neighborhood got too rich. No one looks like me anymore. 
The streets are clean, and there are new trees and when I stand on my block, it doesn’t feel like home anymore. It's not my block anymore.
