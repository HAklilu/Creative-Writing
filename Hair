What I am most grateful for is my long, curly, black hair that extends down my back.
 
Being the only girl in my family, my mother makes sure that my hair is taken care of. Monthly, she pulls, tugs, and combs my hair to braid it in traditional patterns as she chats with other Ethiopian mothers also braiding their daughters’ hairs. Being yelled at in Amharic to keep my head still during the painful process is usual, so is my scalp growing numb and reeking of traditional hair butter. Still, though, my hair is my favorite feature of mine.
 
The reason I am grateful for my hair isn’t because of vanity. It is because I have learned a lot about my culture through it. Hair braiding takes 3 hours, and these are 3 hours of discovering my Ethiopian heritage. During it, my mother tells stories of her time in Ethiopia, from getting into mischief with her friends in the countryside, and her encounters with my father, to her opinion of ,politics in the country. And of course, it’s also where I overhear all the gossip in the Ethiopian community. These hair braiding sessions are really where I’ve learned the most about my country, which I value significantly. There are no classes or even history book chapters on Ethiopian history in my school, but my hair gives me the chance to learn about the history the best way possible, first hand from my mother and other women in the Ethiopian community. It’s really an unofficial class with untold stories that only Ethiopian girls are lucky enough to take. I am grateful for my hair because it allows me to be part of this important class, and it because it is a physical reminder of my roots. I love my hair.
